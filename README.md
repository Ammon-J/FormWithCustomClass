# Custom Form Project

This project will get practice using more TypeScript, form validation, and introduce custom classes.

The project will also use CSS to make a decent looking webpage that is responsive to screen size.

Here is the live site: [Ammon Johnson]("https://ammon-j.github.io/FormWithCustomClass/").
